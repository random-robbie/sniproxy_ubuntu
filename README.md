SNI Proxy by dlundquist
=========

Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the hostname contained in
the initial request of the TCP session. This enables HTTPS name-based virtual
hosting to separate backend servers without installing the private key on the
proxy machine.

News
----

This is just a deb build for me but others can use it pre-built

Features
--------
+ Name-based proxying of HTTPS without decrypting traffic. No keys or
  certificates required.
+ Supports both TLS and HTTP protocols.
+ Supports IPv4, IPv6 and Unix domain sockets for both back end servers and
  listeners.
+ Supports multiple listening sockets per instance.
